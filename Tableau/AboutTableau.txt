The *.twbx files in this directory were created with Tableau Public, a free version of Tableau's visualization software available for download here: https://public.tableau.com/en-us/s/ (must supply valid email address).

Tableau Public files can be uploaded for free to the Tableau Public hosting site (menu option File > Save to Tableau Public…).  Files, once uploaded, can be shared and also embedded in other websites.

For anyone wishing to learn how to use Tableau Public, there are free training resources (including video tutorials) at https://public.tableau.com/en-us/s/resources.  There are also featured "Viz of the Day" examples of what other people have done in the Gallery (https://public.tableau.com/en-us/gallery/?tab=viz-of-the-day&type=viz-of-the-day).

Note that when creating a visualization, data must be presented to the Tableau Public tool in CSVs, spreadsheets, direct database access, etc.  Data that is used to create the visualization is embedded directly into the .twbx file.  If you have corrections or additions later, that data must be absorbed into the .tbwx file prior to uploading the updated file into the Tableau Public hosting site.
